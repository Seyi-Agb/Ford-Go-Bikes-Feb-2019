# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset
This dataset covers information about 183,412 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in the month of February 2019. Each ride data consists of up to 16 variables including the ride characteristics (duration of ride, start and end bike stations), the rider's demographic (gender and birth year) and the rider's characteristic (user type and enrollment in bike share for all initiative). Data can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chirag02/ford-gobike-2019feb-tripdata)


## Summary of Findings
The main purpose of the analysis was to explore the various variables in a bike sharing dataset obtained in February 2019 from Ford GoBikes in San Franisco. Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate visualisation were used for analysis. Below are the main findings from the analysis:
1. Adults aged 18-39 years utilised the bikes sharing service the most
2. The average ride duration in February 2019 is between 5-13 mins
3. Male riders (75%) made the majority of the riders
4. Most riders are subscribers (90.5%) to Ford GoBikes bike sharing
5. Thursdays were the days were the highest number of bike rides was recorded.  Weekends recorded the lowest number of bike rides.
6. During the weekday, the most popular times for bike rides were 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m.. During the weekends the  busiest period of bike rides were between 1-4 p.m.
7. The average duration of bike rides was lowest during the weekdays and highest during the weekend.
8. There is no correlation between the bike ride duration and the rider's birth year, as other factors may affect the ride duration
9. Men took the fastest average bike trips compared to other genders which took the slowest trips
10. Subscribers also had the fastest average bike trip duration compared to unregistered customers
11. The top 2 popular start and end bike stations are Market Street at 10 St and San Francisco Caltrain Station 2
12. The proportion of women riding bikes increase as the riders got younger. While that of other gender decreased as riders got younger
13. 70-79 year olds have the highest proportion of enrollments in the bike share for all initiaitive and  30-39 year olds had the lowest proportion of enrollments in bike share
14. Gender has minimal effect on subscription to the bike share while for the enrollment in the bike share for all initiative, females had the highest proportion of enrollment.


## Key Insights for Presentation
For the purpose of the presentation, I focussed on bike share rider's demographic data and characteristics as it relates to the bike ride counts and average ride duration. In addition, I was able to determine the popular bike stations as well as the busiest times and days for bike rides.
